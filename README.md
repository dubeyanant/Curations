# Curations

## Vision

This website will be a curated space where I will showcase my thoughts, ideas, and content. The main goal is to provide a clean and minimalistic platform for users to explore curated content seamlessly.

## Goals

- **Clean Look:** The website will aim for a clean and clutter-free design, ensuring a pleasant user experience.

- **Minimalistic Animations:** Subtle animations will be incorporated to enhance the user interface without overwhelming the design.

- **Read and Write Modes:**

  - By default, the website will open in read mode, allowing everyone to access curated content effortlessly.
  - Write mode will be restricted to authorized users with a specific ID and password. This mode will enable modifications to tabs and curated content.

- **Content Modification:**

  - The plus button will facilitate the addition of more curated content, providing a user-friendly input interface.
  - Each content item will have a cross button for easy removal and a hide button to manage visibility.

- **Tab Management:**

  - Similar functionality for tabs will allow users to add, remove, and modify them as needed.

- **Dark Mode:**
  - The website will offer a dark mode option for users who prefer a reduced eye strain experience.
