## Goals

- **Clean Look:** I prioritize a clutter-free design, aiming to deliver a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.

- **Minimalistic Animations:** I've thoughtfully incorporated subtle animations to enhance the user interface without overwhelming the design.

- **Read and Write Modes:**

  - By default, the website opens in read mode, ensuring easy access to curated content for everyone.
  - Write mode is reserved for authorized users with specific credentials. This mode enables modifications to tabs and curated content.

- **Content Modification:**

  - The plus button simplifies the addition of curated content, providing a user-friendly input interface.
  - Each content item features a cross button for easy removal and a hide button to manage visibility.

- **Tab Management:**

  - Similar functionality for tabs empowers me to add, remove, and modify them as needed.

- **Dark Mode:**
  - The website offers a dark mode option for users who prefer a reduced eye strain experience.
